There is a known problem in that the `manyfiles' test will fail under
Solaris if you set your soft limit on the number of file descriptors to
above 256.  This is due to a "feature" of fdopen that an fd must be
less than 256 (see fdopen(3)).

IMHO this is Sun's problem, not mine.

awktab.c has the following bogus logic:

#ifndef alloca
#ifdef __GNUC__
#define alloca __builtin_alloca
#else /* not GNU C.  */
#if (!defined (__STDC__) && defined (sparc)) || defined (__sparc__) || defined (__sparc) || defined (__sgi)
#include <alloca.h>
#else /* not sparc */

Solaris x86 obviously dosn't define sparc or __sparc.

What you _meant_ to say was:

if (defined(__sun) && defined(__SVR4))

(which identifies Solaris 2.x under both Sun's cc and gcc)
