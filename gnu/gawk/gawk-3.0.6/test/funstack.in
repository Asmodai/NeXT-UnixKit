%%%                        The size of the original cacm.bib file
%%%                        covering 1958--1996 became too large (about
%%%                        4000 entries) for BibTeX and TeX to handle,
%%%                        so at version 1.44, it was split into
%%%                        cacm1950.bib, cacm1960.bib, cacm1970.bib,
%%%                        cacm1980.bib, and cacm1990.bib, each covering
%%%                        the decade starting with the year embedded in
%%%                        the filename.  Version numbers for these
%%%                        files begin at 2.00.
%%%
%%%                        Volumes from the 1990s average more than 200
%%%                        articles yearly, so a complete bibliography
%%%                        for this journal could contain more than 6000
%%%                        entries from 1958 to 2000.
%%%
%%%                        These bibliographies also include ACM
%%%                        Algorithms 1--492.  For Algorithms 493--686,

%%%                        that citing a paper will automatically
%%%                        generate citations for those Remarks and
%%%                        Corrigenda.  Cross-referenced entries are
%%%                        duplicated in cacm19*.bib and toms.bib, so
%%%                        that each is completely self-contained.
