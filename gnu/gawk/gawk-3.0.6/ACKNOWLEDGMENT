The current developers of Gawk would like to thank and acknowledge the
many people who have contributed to the development through bug reports
and fixes and suggestions.  Unfortunately, we have not been organized
enough to keep track of all the names -- for that we apologize.

The following people were involved in porting gawk to different platforms.

	Mike Lijewski <mjlx@eagle.cnsf.cornell.edu> (IBM RS6000)
	Kent Williams (MSDOS 2.11)
	Conrad Kwok (MSDOS earlier versions)
	Scott Garfinkle (MSDOS earlier versions)
	Hal Peterson <hrp@pecan.cray.com> (Cray)

This group of people comprise the "GAWK crack portability team", who
test the pre-releases and ensure portability of gawk.

	Pat Rankin <gawk.rankin@EQL.Caltech.Edu> (VMS)
	Michal Jaegermann <michal@gortel.phys.UAlberta.CA>
		(Atari, NeXT, DEC 3100)
	Scott Deifik <scottd@amgen.com> (MSDOS 2.14, 2.15, 3.0)
	Kai Uwe Rommel <rommel@ars.de> (OS/2)
	Darrel Hankerson <hankedr@mail.auburn.edu> (DOS and formerly OS/2)
	Mark Moraes <Mark-Moraes@deshaw.com> (Code Center, Purify)
	Kaveh Ghazi <ghazi@noc.rutgers.edu> (Lots of Unix variants)

Michal, Scott and Darrel go out of their way to make sure that gawk
works on non-32 bit systems, and keep me on track where portability is
concerned.  Indeed, all of these folks are incredibly helpful; gawk would
not be the fine program it is now without them.
  
Last, but far from least, we would like to thank Brian Kernighan who
has helped to clear up many dark corners of the language and provided a
restraining touch when we have been overly tempted by "feeping
creaturism".
