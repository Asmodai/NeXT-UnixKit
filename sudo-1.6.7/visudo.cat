       vviissuuddoo edits the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file in a safe fashion, analogous
       to _v_i_p_w(1m).  vviissuuddoo locks the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file against multi­
       ple simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks, and
       checks for parse errors.  If the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file is currently
       being edited you will receive a message to try again
       later.

       There is a hard-coded list of editors that vviissuuddoo will use
       set at compile-time that may be overridden via the _e_d_i_t_o_r
       _s_u_d_o_e_r_s Default variable.  This list defaults to the path
       to _v_i(1) on your system, as determined by the _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e
       script.  Normally, vviissuuddoo does not honor the EDITOR or
       VISUAL environment variables unless they contain an editor
       in the aforementioned editors list.  However, if vviissuuddoo is
       configured with the _-_-_w_i_t_h_-_e_n_v_e_d_i_t_o_r flag or the _e_n_v_e_d_i_t_o_r
       Default variable is set in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, vviissuuddoo will use any
       the editor defines by EDITOR or VISUAL.  Note that this
       can be a security hole since it allows the user to execute
       any program they wish simply by setting EDITOR or VISUAL.

       vviissuuddoo parses the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file after the edit and will not
       save the changes if there is a syntax error.  Upon finding
       an error, vviissuuddoo will print a message stating the line
       number(s) where the error occurred and the user will
       receive the "What now?" prompt.  At this point the user
       may enter "e" to re-edit the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file, "x" to exit
       without saving the changes, or "Q" to quit and save
       changes.  The "Q" option should be used with extreme care
       because if vviissuuddoo believes there to be a parse error, so
       will ssuuddoo and no one will be able to ssuuddoo again until the
       error is fixed.  If "e" is typed to edit the  _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file
       after a parse error has been detected, the cursor will be
       placed on the line where the error occurred (if the editor
       supports this feature).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       vviissuuddoo accepts the following command line options:

       -c  Enable cchheecckk--oonnllyy mode.  The existing _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file
           will be checked for syntax and a message will be
           printed to the standard output detailing the status of
           _s_u_d_o_e_r_s.  If the syntax check completes successfully,
           vviissuuddoo will exit with a value of 0.  If a syntax error
           is encountered, vviissuuddoo will exit with a value of 1.

       -f  Specify and alternate _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file location.  With
           this option vviissuuddoo will edit (or check) the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s

           alias is used before it is defined, vviissuuddoo will con­
           sider this a parse error.  Note that it is not possi­
           ble to differentiate between an alias and a hostname
           or username that consists solely of uppercase letters,
           digits, and the underscore ('_') character.

       -V  The --VV (version) option causes vviissuuddoo to print its
           version number and exit.
