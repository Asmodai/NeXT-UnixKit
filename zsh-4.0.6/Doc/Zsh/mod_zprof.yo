COMMENT(!MOD!zsh/zprof
A module allowing profiling for shell functions.
!MOD!)
cindex(functions, profiling)
When loaded, the tt(zsh/zprof) causes shell functions to be profiled.
The profiling results can be obtained with the tt(zprof)
builtin command made available by this module.  There is no way to turn 
profiling off other than unloading the module.

startitem()
findex(zprof)
item(tt(zprof) [ tt(-c) ])(
Without the tt(-c) option, tt(zprof) lists profiling results to
standard output.  The format is comparable to that of commands like
tt(gprof).

At the top there is a summary listing all functions that were called
at least once.  This summary is sorted in decreasing order of the
amount of time spent in each.  The lines contain
the number of the function in order, which is used in 
other parts of the list in suffixes of the form
`tt([)var(num)tt(])'), then the number of calls made to the function.
The next three columns list the time in
milliseconds spent in the function and its descendents, the average
time in milliseconds spent in the function and its descendents per
call and the percentage of time spent in all shell functions used in
this function and its descendents.  The following three columns give
the same information, but counting only the time spent in the function 
itself.  The final column shows the name of the function.

After the summary, detailed information about every function that was
invoked is listed, sorted in decreasing order of the amount of time spent
in each function and its descendents.  Each of these entries consists of
descriptions for the functions that called the function described, the
function itself, and the functions that were called from it.  The
description for the function itself has the same format as in the summary
(and shows the same information).  The other lines don't show the number of
the function at the beginning and have their function named indented to
make it easier to distinguish the line showing the function described in
the section from the surrounding lines.

The information shown in this case is almost the same as in the summary,
but only refers to the call hierarchy being displayed.  For example, for a
calling function the column showing the total running time lists the time
spent in the described function and its descendents only for the times when
it was called from that particular calling function.  Likewise, for a
called function, this columns lists the total time spent in the called
function and its descendents only for the times when it was called from the
function described.

Also in this case, the column showing the number of calls to a function
also shows a slash and then the total number of invocations made to the
called function.

As long as the tt(zsh/zprof) module is loaded, profiling will be done and
multiple invocations of the tt(zprof) builtin command will show the
times and numbers of calls since the module was loaded.  With the
tt(-c) option, the tt(zprof) builtin command will reset its internal
counters and will not show the listing.
