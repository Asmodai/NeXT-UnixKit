COMMENT(!MOD!zsh/stat
A builtin command interface to the tt(stat) system call.
!MOD!)
The tt(zsh/stat) module makes available one builtin command:

startitem()
findex(stat)
cindex(files, listing)
cindex(files, examining)
item(tt(stat) [ tt(-gnNolLtTrs) ] [ tt(-f) var(fd) ] \
    [ tt(-H) var(hash) ] [ tt(-A) var(array) ] \
    [ tt(-F) var(fmt) ] [ tt(PLUS())var(element) ] [ var(file) ... ])(
The command acts as a front end to the tt(stat) system call (see
manref(stat)(2)).
If the tt(stat) call fails, the appropriate system error message
printed and status 1 is returned.
The fields of tt(struct stat) give information about
the files provided as arguments to the command.  In addition to those
available from the tt(stat) call, an extra element `tt(link)' is provided.
These elements are:

startitem()
item(tt(device))(
The number of the device on which the file resides.
)
item(tt(inode))(
The unique number of the file on this device (`em(inode)' number).
)
item(tt(mode))(
The mode of the file; that is, the file's type and access permissions.
With the tt(-s) option, this will
be returned as a string corresponding to the first column in the
display of the tt(ls -l) command.
)
item(tt(nlink))(
The number of hard links to the file.
)
item(tt(uid))(
The user ID of the owner of the file.  With the tt(-s)
option, this is displayed as a user name.
)
item(tt(gid))(
The group ID of the file.  With the tt(-s) option, this
is displayed as a group name.
)
item(tt(rdev))(
The raw device number.  This is only useful for special devices.
)
item(tt(size))(
The size of the file in bytes.
)
xitem(tt(atime))
xitem(tt(mtime))
item(tt(ctime))(
The last access, modification and inode change times
of the file, respectively, as the number of seconds since
midnight GMT on 1st January, 1970.  With the tt(-s) option,
these are printed as strings for the local time zone; the format
can be altered with the tt(-F) option, and with the tt(-g)
option the times are in GMT.
)
item(tt(blksize))(
The number of bytes in one allocation block on the
device on which the file resides.
)
item(tt(block))(
The number of disk blocks used by the file.
)
item(tt(link))(
If the file is a link and the tt(-L) option is in
effect, this contains the name of the file linked to, otherwise
it is empty.  Note that if this element is selected (``tt(stat PLUS()link)'')
then the tt(-L) option is automatically used.
)
enditem()

A particular element may be selected by including its name
preceded by a `tt(PLUS())' in the option list; only one element is allowed.
The element may be shortened to any unique set of leading
characters.  Otherwise, all elements will be shown for all files.

Options:

startitem()
item(tt(-A) var(array))(
Instead of displaying the results on standard
output, assign them to an var(array), one tt(struct stat) element per array
element for each file in order.  In this case neither the name
of the element nor the name of the files appears in var(array) unless the
tt(-t) or tt(-n) options were given, respectively.  If tt(-t) is given,
the element name appears as a prefix to the
appropriate array element; if tt(-n) is given, the file name
appears as a separate array element preceding all the others.
Other formatting options are respected.
)
item(tt(-H) var(hash))(
Similar to tt(-A), but instead assign the values to var(hash).  The keys
are the elements listed above.  If the tt(-n) option is provided then the
name of the file is included in the hash with key tt(name).
)
item(tt(-f) var(fd))(
Use the file on file descriptor var(fd) instead of
named files; no list of file names is allowed in this case.
)
item(tt(-F) var(fmt))(
Supplies a tt(strftime) (see manref(strftime)(3)) string for the
formatting of the time elements.  The tt(-s) option is implied.
)
item(tt(-g))(
Show the time elements in the GMT time zone.  The
tt(-s) option is implied.
)
item(tt(-l))(
List the names of the type elements (to standard
output or an array as appropriate) and return immediately;
options other than tt(-A) and arguments are ignored.
)
item(tt(-L))(
Perform an tt(lstat) (see manref(lstat)(2)) rather than a tt(stat)
system call.  In this case, if the file is a link, information
about the link itself rather than the target file is returned.
This option is required to make the tt(link) element useful.
)
item(tt(-n))(
Always show the names of files.  Usually these are
only shown when output is to standard output and there is more
than one file in the list.
)
item(tt(-N))(
Never show the names of files.
)
item(tt(-o))(
If a raw file mode is printed, show it in octal, which is more useful for
human consumption than the default of decimal.  A leading zero will be
printed in this case.  Note that this does not affect whether a raw or
formatted file mode is shown, which is controlled by the tt(-r) and tt(-s)
options, nor whether a mode is shown at all.
)
item(tt(-r))(
Print raw data (the default format) alongside string
data (the tt(-s) format); the string data appears in parentheses
after the raw data.
)
item(tt(-s))(
Print tt(mode), tt(uid), tt(gid) and the three time
elements as strings instead of numbers.  In each case the format
is like that of tt(ls -l).
)
item(tt(-t))(
Always show the type names for the elements of
tt(struct stat).  Usually these are only shown when output is to
standard output and no individual element has been selected.
)
item(tt(-T))(
Never show the type names of the tt(struct stat) elements.
