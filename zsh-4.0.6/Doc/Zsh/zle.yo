sect(Description)
pindex(ZLE, use of)
If the tt(ZLE) option is set (which it is by default in interactive shells)
and the shell input is attached to the terminal, the user
is able to edit command lines.

There are two display modes.  The first, multiline mode, is the
default.  It only works if the tt(TERM) parameter is set to a valid
terminal type that can move the cursor up.  The second, single line
mode, is used if tt(TERM) is invalid or incapable of moving the
cursor up, or if the tt(SINGLE_LINE_ZLE) option is set.
pindex(SINGLE_LINE_ZLE, use of)
cindex(ksh, editor mode)
cindex(editor ksh style)
This mode
is similar to bf(ksh), and uses no termcap sequences.  If tt(TERM) is
"emacs", the tt(ZLE) option will be unset by default.

vindex(BAUD, use of)
vindex(COLUMNS, use of)
vindex(LINES, use of)
The parameters tt(BAUD), tt(COLUMNS), and tt(LINES) are also used by the
line editor.

texinode(Keymaps)(Zle Builtins)()(Zsh Line Editor)
sect(Keymaps)
cindex(keymaps)
cindex(key bindings)
cindex(bindings, key)
A keymap in ZLE contains a set of bindings between key sequences
and ZLE commands.  The empty key sequence cannot be bound.

There can be any number of keymaps at any time, and each keymap has one
or more names.  If all of a keymap's names are deleted, it disappears.
findex(bindkey, use of)
tt(bindkey) can be used to manipulate keymap names.

Initially, there are four keymaps:

startsitem()
sitem(tt(emacs))(EMACS emulation)
sitem(tt(viins))(vi emulation - insert mode)
sitem(tt(vicmd))(vi emulation - command mode)
sitem(tt(.safe))(fallback keymap)
endsitem()

The `tt(.safe)' keymap is special.  It can never be altered, and the name
can never be removed.  However, it can be linked to other names, which can
be removed.  In the future other special keymaps may be added; users should
avoid using names beginning with `tt(.)' for their own keymaps.

vindex(VISUAL)
vindex(EDITOR)
In addition to these four names, either `tt(emacs)' or `tt(viins)' is
also linked to the name `tt(main)'.  If one of the tt(VISUAL) or
tt(EDITOR) environment variables contain the string `tt(vi)' when the shell
starts up then it will be `tt(viins)', otherwise it will be `tt(emacs)'.
tt(bindkey)'s tt(-e) and tt(-v)
options provide a convenient way to override this default choice.

When the editor starts up, it will select the `tt(main)' keymap.
If that keymap doesn't exist, it will use `tt(.safe)' instead.

In the `tt(.safe)' keymap, each single key is bound to tt(self-insert),
except for ^J (line feed) and ^M (return) which are bound to tt(accept-line).
This is deliberately not pleasant to use; if you are using it, it
means you deleted the main keymap, and you should put it back.
subsect(Reading Commands)
When ZLE is reading a command from the terminal, it may read a sequence
that is bound to some command and is also a prefix of a longer bound string.
In this case ZLE will wait a certain time to see if more characters
are typed, and if not (or they don't match any longer string) it will
execute the binding.  This timeout is defined by the tt(KEYTIMEOUT) parameter;
its default is 0.4 sec.  There is no timeout if the prefix string is not
itself bound to a command.

As well as ZLE commands, key sequences can be bound to other strings, by using
`tt(bindkey -s)'.
When such a sequence is read, the replacement string is pushed back as input,
and the command reading process starts again using these fake keystrokes.
This input can itself invoke further replacement strings, but in order to
detect loops the process will be stopped if there are twenty such replacements
without a real command being read.

texinode(Zle Builtins)(Zle Widgets)(Keymaps)(Zsh Line Editor)
sect(Zle Builtins)
cindex(zle, builtin commands)
The ZLE module contains three related builtin commands. The tt(bindkey)
command manipulates keymaps and key bindings; the tt(vared) command invokes
ZLE on the value of a shell parameter; and the tt(zle) command manipulates
editing widgets and allows command line access to ZLE commands from within
shell functions.

item(tt(bindkey) [ var(options) ] [ var(in-string) ])(
tt(bindkey)'s options can be divided into three categories: keymap selection,
operation selection, and others.  The keymap selection options are:

startitem()
item(tt(-e))(
Selects keymap `tt(emacs)', and also links it to `tt(main)'.
)
item(tt(-v))(
Selects keymap `tt(viins)', and also links it to `tt(main)'.
)
item(tt(-a))(
Selects keymap `tt(vicmd)'.
)
item(tt(-M))(
The first non-option argument is used as a keymap name,
and does not otherwise count as an argument.
)
enditem()

If a keymap selection is required and none of the options above are used, the
`tt(main)' keymap is used.  Some operations do not permit a keymap to be
selected, namely:

startitem()
item(tt(-l))(
List all existing keymap names.  If the tt(-L)
option is also used, list in the form of tt(bindkey)
commands to create the keymaps.
)
item(tt(-d))(
Delete all existing keymaps and reset to the default state.
)
item(tt(-D) var(keymap) ...)(
Delete the named var(keymap)s.
)
item(tt(-A) var(old-keymap new-keymap))(
Make the var(new-keymap) name an alias for var(old-keymap), so that
both names refer to the same keymap.  The names have equal standing;
if either is deleted, the other remains.  If there is already a keymap
with the var(new-keymap) name, it is deleted.
)
item(tt(-N) var(new-keymap) [ var(old-keymap) ])(
Create a new keymap, named var(new-keymap).  If a keymap already has that
name, it is deleted.  If an var(old-keymap) name is given, the new keymap
is initialized to be a duplicate of it, otherwise the new keymap will
be empty.
)
enditem()

To use a newly created keymap, it should be linked to tt(main).  Hence
the sequence of commands to create and use a new keymap `tt(mymap)'
initialized from the tt(emacs) keymap (which remains unchanged) is:

example(bindkey -N mymap emacs
bindkey -A mymap main)

Note that while `tt(bindkey -A) var(newmap) tt(main)' will work when
var(newmap) is tt(emacs) or tt(viins), it will not work for tt(vicmd), as
switching from vi insert to command mode becomes impossible.

The following operations act on the `tt(main)' keymap if no keymap
selection option was given:

startitem()
item(tt(-m))(
Add the built-in set of meta-key bindings to the selected keymap.
Only keys that are unbound or bound to tt(self-insert) are affected.
)
item(tt(-r) var(in-string) ...)(
Unbind the specified var(in-string)s in the selected keymap.
This is exactly equivalent to binding the strings to tt(undefined-key).

When tt(-R) is also used, interpret the var(in-string)s as ranges.

When tt(-p) is also used, the var(in-string)s specify prefixes.  Any
binding that has the given var(in-string) as a prefix, not including the
binding for the var(in-string) itself, if any, will be removed.  For
example,

example(bindkey -rpM viins '^[')

will remove all bindings in the vi-insert keymap beginning with an escape
character (probably cursor keys), but leave the binding for the escape
character itself (probably tt(vi-cmd-mode)).  This is incompatible with the
option tt(-R).
)
item(tt(-s) var(in-string out-string) ...)(
Bind each var(in-string) to each var(out-string).
When var(in-string) is typed, var(out-string) will be
pushed back and treated as input to the line editor.
When tt(-R) is also used, interpret the var(in-string)s as ranges.
)
item(var(in-string command) ...)(
Bind each var(in-string) to each var(command).
When tt(-R) is used, interpret the var(in-string)s as ranges.
)
item([ var(in-string) ])(
List key bindings.  If an var(in-string) is specified, the binding of
that string in the selected keymap is displayed.  Otherwise, all key
bindings in the selected keymap are displayed.  (As a special case,
if the tt(-e) or tt(-v) option is used alone, the keymap is em(not)
displayed - the implicit linking of keymaps is the only thing that
happens.)

When the option tt(-p) is used, the var(in-string) must be present.
The listing shows all bindings which have the given key sequence as a
prefix, not including any bindings for the key sequence itself.

When the tt(-L) option is used, the list is in the form of tt(bindkey)
commands to create the key bindings.
)
enditem()

When the tt(-R) option is used as noted above, a valid range consists of
two characters, with an optional `tt(-)' between them.  All characters
between the two specified, inclusive, are bound as specified.

For either var(in-string) or var(out-string), the following
escape sequences are recognised:

startsitem()
sitem(tt(\a))(bell character)
sitem(tt(\b))(backspace)
sitem(tt(\e), tt(\E))(escape)
sitem(tt(\f))(form feed)
sitem(tt(\n))(linefeed (newline))
sitem(tt(\r))(carriage return)
sitem(tt(\t))(horizontal tab)
sitem(tt(\v))(vertical tab)
sitem(tt(\)var(NNN))(character code in octal)
sitem(tt(\x)var(NN))(character code in hexadecimal)
sitem(tt(\M)[tt(-)]var(X))(character with meta bit set)
sitem(tt(\C)[tt(-)]var(X))(control character)
sitem(tt(^)var(X))(control character)
endsitem()

In all other cases, `tt(\)' escapes the following character.  Delete is
written as `tt(^?)'.  Note that `tt(\M^?)' and `tt(^\M?)' are not the same,
and that (unlike emacs), the bindings `tt(\M-)var(X)' and `tt(\e)var(X)'
are entirely distinct, although they are initialized to the same bindings
by `tt(bindkey -m)'.
)
findex(vared)
cindex(parameters, editing)
cindex(editing parameters)
item(tt(vared) [ tt(-Aache) ] [ tt(-p) var(prompt) ] [ tt(-r) var(rprompt) ] var(name))(
The value of the parameter var(name) is loaded into the edit
buffer, and the line editor is invoked.  When the editor exits,
var(name) is set to the string value returned by the editor.
When the tt(-c) flag is given, the parameter is created if it doesn't
already exist.  The tt(-a) flag may be given with tt(-c) to create
an array parameter, or the tt(-A) flag to create an associative array.
If the type of an existing parameter does not match the type to be
created, the parameter is unset and recreated.

If an array or array slice is being edited, separator characters as defined
in tt($IFS) will be shown quoted with a backslash, as will backslashes
themselves.  Conversely, when the edited text is split into an array, a
backslash quotes an immediately following separator character or backslash;
no other special handling of backslashes, or any handling of quotes, is
performed.

Individual elements of existing array or associative array parameters
may be edited by using subscript syntax on var(name).  New elements are
created automatically, even without tt(-c).

If the tt(-p) flag is given, the following string will be taken as
the prompt to display at the left.  If the tt(-r) flag is given,
the following string gives the prompt to display at the right.  If the
tt(-h) flag is specified, the history can be accessed from ZLE. If the 
tt(-e) flag is given, typing tt(^D) (Control-D) on an empty line
causes tt(vared) to exit immediately with a non-zero return value.

item(tt(zle))(
The tt(zle) builtin performs a number of different actions concerning
ZLE.  Which operation it performs depends on its options:

startitem()
item(tt(-l) [ tt(-L) | tt(-a) ])(
List all existing user-defined widgets.  If the tt(-L)
option is used, list in the form of tt(zle)
commands to create the widgets.

When combined with the tt(-a) option, all widget names are listed,
including the builtin ones. In this case the tt(-L) option is ignored.

If at least one var(string) is given, nothing will be printed but the
return status will be zero if all var(string)s are names of existing
widgets (or of user-defined widgets if the tt(-a) flag is not given)
and non-zero if at least one var(string) is not a name of an defined
widget.
)
item(tt(-D) var(widget) ...)(
Delete the named var(widget)s.
)
item(tt(-A) var(old-widget) var(new-widget))(
Make the var(new-widget) name an alias for var(old-widget), so that
both names refer to the same widget.  The names have equal standing;
if either is deleted, the other remains.  If there is already a widget
with the var(new-widget) name, it is deleted.
)
item(tt(-N) var(widget) [ var(function) ])(
Create a user-defined widget.  If there is already a widget with the
specified name, it is overwritten.  When the new
widget is invoked from within the editor, the specified shell var(function)
is called.  If no function name is specified, it defaults to
the same name as the widget.  For further information, see the section
em(Widgets) in
ifzman(zmanref(zshzle))\
ifnzman(noderef(Zsh Line Editor))\
.
)
cindex(completion widgets, creating)
item(tt(-C) var(widget) var(completion-widget) var(function))(
Create a user-defined completion widget named var(widget). The 
completion widget will behave like the built-in completion-widget
whose name is given as var(completion-widget). To generate the
completions, the shell function var(function) will be called.
For further information, see
ifzman(zmanref(zshcompwid))\
ifnzman(noderef(Completion Widgets))\
.
)
item(tt(-R) [ tt(-c) ] [ var(display-string) ] [ var(string) ... ])(
Redisplay the command line; this is to be called from within a user-defined
widget to allow changes to become visible.  If a var(display-string) is
given and not empty, this is shown in the status line (immediately
below the line being edited).

If the optional var(string)s are given they are listed below the
prompt in the same way as completion lists are printed. If no
var(string)s are given but the tt(-c) option is used such a list is
cleared.

Note that this option is only useful for widgets that do not exit
immediately after using it because the strings displayed will be erased 
immediately after return from the widget.

This command can safely be called outside user defined widgets; if zle is
active, the display will be refreshed, while if zle is not active, the
command has no effect.  In this case there will usually be no other
arguments.  The status is zero if zle was active, else one.
)
item(tt(-M) var(string))(
As with the tt(-R) option, the var(string) will be displayed below the 
command line; unlike the tt(-R) option, the string will not be put into
the status line but will instead be printed normally below the
prompt.  This means that the var(string) will still be displayed after
the widget returns (until it is overwritten by subsequent commands).
)
item(tt(-U) var(string))(
This pushes the characters in the var(string) onto the input stack of
ZLE.  After the widget currently executed finishes ZLE will behave as
if the characters in the var(string) were typed by the user.

As ZLE uses a stack, if this option is used repeatedly
the last string pushed onto the stack will be processed first.  However,
the characters in each var(string) will be processed in the order in which
they appear in the string.
)
item(tt(-I))(
Unusually, this option is only useful em(outside) ordinary widget functions.
It invalidates the current zle display in preparation for output; usually
this will be from a trap function.  It has no effect if zle is not
active.  When a trap exits, the shell checks to see if the display needs
restoring, hence the following will print output in such a way as not to
disturb the line being edited:

example(TRAPUSR1() {
    # Invalidate zle display
  zle -I
    # Show output
  print Hello
})

Note that there are better ways of manipulating the display from within zle
widgets.  In general, the trap function may need to test whether zle is
loaded before using this method; if it is not, there is no point in loading
it specially since the line editor will not be active.

The status is zero if zle was active, else one.
)
item(var(widget) tt([ -n) var(num) tt(]) tt([ -N ]) var(args) ...)(
Invoke the specified widget.  This can only be done when ZLE is
active; normally this will be within a user-defined widget.

With the options tt(-n) and tt(-N), the current numerical argument will be
saved and then restored after the call to tt(widget); `tt(-n) var(num)'
sets the numerical argument temporarily to var(num), while `tt(-N)' sets it
to the default, i.e. as if there were none.

Any further arguments will be passed to the widget.  If it is a shell
function, these are passed down as positional parameters; for builtin
widgets it is up to the widget in question what it does with them.
Currently arguments are only handled by the incremental-search commands,
the tt(history-search-forward) and tt(-backward) and the corresponding
functions prefixed by tt(vi-), and by tt(universal-argument).  No error is
flagged if the command does not use the arguments, or only uses some of
them.

The return status reflects the success or failure of the operation carried
out by the widget, or if it is a user-defined widget the return status of
the shell function.  

A non-zero return status causes the shell to beep when the widget exits,
unless the tt(BEEP) options was unset or the widget was called via the
tt(zle) command.  Thus if a user defined widget requires an immediate beep,
it should call the tt(beep) widget directly.
)
enditem()

With no options and no arguments, only the return status will be
set. It is zero if ZLE is currently active and widgets could be
invoked using this builtin command and non-zero if ZLE is not active.

texinode(Zle Widgets)()(Zle Builtins)(Zsh Line Editor)
sect(Widgets)
cindex(widgets)
All actions in the editor are performed by `widgets'.  A widget's job is
simply to perform some small action.  The ZLE commands that key sequences
in keymaps are bound to are in fact widgets.  Widgets can be user-defined
or built in.

The standard widgets built in to ZLE are listed in Standard Widgets below.
Other built-in widgets can be defined by other modules (see
ifzman(zmanref(zshmodules))\
ifnzman(noderef(Zsh Modules))\
).  Each built-in widget has two names: its normal canonical name, and the
same name preceded by a `tt(.)'.  The `tt(.)' name is special: it can't be
rebound to a different widget.  This makes the widget available even when
its usual name has been redefined.

User-defined widgets are defined using `tt(zle -N)', and implemented
as shell functions.  When the widget is executed, the corresponding
shell function is executed, and can perform editing (or other) actions.
It is recommended that user-defined widgets should not have names
starting with `tt(.)'.
sect(User-Defined Widgets)
cindex(widgets, user-defined)
User-defined widgets, being implemented as shell functions,
can execute any normal shell command.  They can also run other widgets
(whether built-in or user-defined) using the tt(zle) builtin command.
The standard input of the function is closed to prevent external commands
from unintentionally blocking ZLE by reading from the terminal, but
tt(read -k) or tt(read -q) can be used to read characters.  Finally,
they can examine and edit the ZLE buffer being edited by
reading and setting the special parameters described below.

cindex(parameters, editor)
cindex(parameters, zle)
These special parameters are always available in widget functions, but
are not in any way special outside ZLE.  If they have some normal value
outside ZLE, that value is temporarily inaccessible, but will return
when the widget function exits.  These special parameters in fact have
local scope, like parameters created in a function using tt(local).

Inside completion widgets and traps called while ZLE is active, these
parameters are available read-only.

startitem()
vindex(BUFFER)
item(tt(BUFFER) (scalar))(
The entire contents of the edit buffer.  If it is written to, the
cursor remains at the same offset, unless that would put it outside the

item(tt(CURSOR) (integer))(
The offset of the cursor, within the edit buffer.  This is in the range
0 to tt($#BUFFER), and is by definition equal to tt($#LBUFFER).

cursor being moved to the appropriate end of the buffer.

vindex(LBUFFER)
item(tt(LBUFFER) (scalar))(
The part of the buffer that lies to the left of the cursor position.
If it is assigned to, only that part of the buffer is replaced, and the
cursor remains between the new tt($LBUFFER) and the old tt($RBUFFER).
)
vindex(MARK)
item(tt(MARK) (integer))(
Like tt(CURSOR), but for the mark.
)
vindex(NUMERIC)
item(tt(NUMERIC) (integer))(
The numeric argument. If no numeric argument was given, this parameter
is unset. When this is set inside a widget function, builtin widgets
called with the tt(zle) builtin command will use the value
assigned. If it is unset inside a widget function, builtin widgets
called behave as if no numeric argument was given.
)
vindex(PENDING)
item(tt(PENDING) (integer))(
The number of bytes pending for input, i.e. the number of bytes which have
already been typed and can immediately be read. On systems where the shell
is not able to get this information, this parameter will always have a
value of zero.
)
vindex(PREBUFFER)
item(tt(PREBUFFER) (scalar))(
In a multi-line input at the secondary prompt, this read-only parameter
contains the contents of the lines before the one the cursor is
currently in.
)
vindex(RBUFFER)
item(tt(RBUFFER) (scalar))(
The part of the buffer that lies to the right of the cursor position.

The following is a list of all the standard widgets,
and their default bindings in emacs mode,
vi command mode and vi insert mode
(the `tt(emacs)', `tt(vicmd)' and `tt(viins)' keymaps, respectively).

Note that cursor keys are bound to movement keys in all three keymaps;
the shell assumes that the cursor keys send the key sequences reported
by the terminal-handling library (termcap or terminfo).  The key sequences
shown in the list are those based on the VT100, common on many modern
terminals, but in fact these are not necessarily bound.  In the case of the
tt(viins) keymap, the initial escape character of the sequences serves also
to return to the tt(vicmd) keymap: whether this happens is determined by
the tt(KEYTIMEOUT) parameter, see ifzman(zmanref(zshparam))\

)
tindex(history-incremental-search-backward)
item(tt(history-incremental-search-backward) (^R ^Xr) (unbound) (unbound))(
Search backward incrementally for a specified string.  The search is
case-insensitive if the search string does not have uppercase letters and no
numeric argument was given.  The string may begin with `tt(^)' to anchor the
search to the beginning of the line.

A restricted set of editing functions
is available in the mini-buffer.  An interrupt signal, as defined by the stty
setting, will stop the search and go back to the original line.  An undefined
key will have the same effect. The supported functions are:
tt(backward-delete-char),
tt(vi-backward-delete-char),
tt(clear-screen),
tt(redisplay),
tt(quoted-insert),
tt(vi-quoted-insert),
tt(accept-and-hold),
tt(accept-and-infer-next-history),
tt(accept-line) and
tt(accept-line-and-down-history).

tt(magic-space) just inserts a space.
tt(vi-cmd-mode) toggles between the `tt(main)' and `tt(vicmd)' keymaps;
the `tt(main)' keymap (insert mode) will be selected initially.
tt(history-incremental-search-backward) will get the
next occurrence of the contents of the mini-buffer.
tt(history-incremental-search-forward) inverts the sense of the search.
tt(vi-repeat-search) and tt(vi-rev-repeat-search) are similarly supported.
The direction of the search is indicated in the mini-buffer.

Any multi-character string
that is not bound to one of the above functions will beep and interrupt the
search, leaving the last found line in the buffer. Any single character that
is not bound to one of the above functions, or tt(self-insert) or
tt(self-insert-unmeta), will have the same effect but the function will be
executed.

When called from a widget function by the tt(zle) command, the incremental
search commands can take a string argument.  This will be treated as a
string of keys, as for arguments to the tt(bindkey) command, and used as
initial input for the command.  Any characters in the string which are
unused by the incremental search will be silently ignored.  For example,

example(zle history-incremental-search-backward forceps)

will search backwards for tt(forceps), leaving the minibuffer containing
the string `tt(forceps)'.
)
tindex(history-incremental-search-forward)
item(tt(history-incremental-search-forward) (^S ^Xs) (unbound) (unbound))(
Search forward incrementally for a specified string.  The search is

item(tt(history-search-backward) (ESC-P ESC-p) (unbound) (unbound))(
Search backward in the history for a line beginning with the first

first word in the buffer.
)
tindex(vi-history-search-backward)
item(tt(vi-history-search-backward) (unbound) (/) (unbound))(
Search backward in the history for a specified string.
The string may begin with `tt(^)' to anchor the search to the
beginning of the line.

A restricted set of editing functions is available in
the mini-buffer.  An interrupt signal, as defined by the stty setting,  will
stop the search.
The functions available in the mini-buffer are:
tt(accept-line),
tt(backward-delete-char),
tt(vi-backward-delete-char),
tt(backward-kill-word),
tt(vi-backward-kill-word),
tt(clear-screen),
tt(redisplay),
tt(quoted-insert)
and
tt(vi-quoted-insert).

tt(vi-cmd-mode) is treated the same as accept-line, and
tt(magic-space) is treated as a space.
Any other character that is not bound to self-insert or
self-insert-unmeta will beep and be ignored. If the function is called from vi
command mode, the bindings of the current insert mode will be used.

If called from a function by the tt(zle) command with arguments, the first
argument is taken as the string for which to search, rather than the
first word in the buffer.

Insert the last word from the previous history event at the
cursor position.  If a positive numeric argument is given,
insert that word from the end of the previous history event.
If the argument is zero or negative insert that word from the
left (zero inserts the previous command word).  Repeating this command
replaces the word just inserted with the last word from the
history event prior to the one just used; numeric arguments can be used in
the same way to pick a word from that event.

tindex(execute-named-cmd)
item(tt(execute-named-cmd) (ESC-x) (unbound) (unbound))(
Read the name of an editor command and
execute it.  A restricted set of editing functions is available in the
mini-buffer.  An interrupt signal, as defined by the stty setting, will
abort the function. The allowed functions are:
tt(backward-delete-char),
tt(vi-backward-delete-char),
tt(clear-screen),
tt(redisplay),
tt(quoted-insert),
tt(vi-quoted-insert),
tt(backward-kill-word),
tt(vi-backward-kill-word),
tt(kill-whole-line),
tt(vi-kill-line),
tt(backward-kill-line),

tt(delete-char-or-list),
tt(complete-word),
tt(accept-line),
tt(expand-or-complete) and
tt(expand-or-complete-prefix).

tt(kill-region) kills the last word,
and vi-cmd-mode is treated the same as accept-line.
The space and tab characters, if not bound to one of
these functions, will complete the name and then list the
possibilities if the tt(AUTO_LIST) option is set.
Any other character that is not bound to tt(self-insert) or
tt(self-insert-unmeta) will beep and be ignored.
The bindings of the current insert mode will be used.
)

cursor position.
)
tindex(pound-insert)
item(tt(pound-insert) (unbound) (#) (unbound))(
If there is no # character at the beginning of the buffer,
add one to the beginning of each line.
If there is one, remove a # from each line that has one.
In either case, accept the current line.
The tt(INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS) option must be set
for this to have any usefulness.
)
tindex(vi-pound-insert)
item(tt(vi-pound-insert))(
If there is no # character at the beginning of the current line,
add one.  If there is one, remove it.
The tt(INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS) option must be set
for this to have any usefulness.
)
tindex(push-input)
item(tt(push-input))(
Push the entire current multiline construct onto the buffer stack and
return to the top-level (tt(PS1)) prompt.
If the current parser construct is only a single line, this is exactly
like tt(push-line).
Next time the editor starts up or is popped with tt(get-line), the
construct will be popped off the top of the buffer stack and loaded
into the editing buffer.
)
tindex(push-line)
item(tt(push-line) (^Q ESC-Q ESC-q) (unbound) (unbound))(
Push the current buffer onto the buffer stack and clear
the buffer.
Next time the editor starts up, the buffer will be popped
off the top of the buffer stack and loaded into the editing
buffer.
)
tindex(push-line-or-edit)
item(tt(push-line-or-edit))(
At the top-level (tt(PS1)) prompt, equivalent to tt(push-line).
At a secondary (tt(PS2)) prompt, move the entire current multiline
construct into the editor buffer.

command `tt(run-help) var(cmd)', where var(cmd) is the current
command.  tt(run-help) is normally aliased to tt(man).
)
tindex(vi-set-buffer)
item(tt(vi-set-buffer) (unbound) (") (unbound))(
Specify a buffer to be used in the following command.
There are 35 buffers that can be specified:
the 26 `named' buffers tt("a) to tt("z)
and the nine `queued' buffers tt("1) to tt("9).  The named buffers can also
be specified as tt("A) to tt("Z).

When a buffer is specified for a cut command, the text being cut replaces
the previous contents of the specified buffer.  If a named buffer
is specified using a capital, the newly cut text is appended to the buffer
instead of overwriting it.

If no buffer is specified for a cut command, tt("1) is used, and the
contents of tt("1) to tt("8) are each shifted along one buffer; the contents of
tt("9) is lost.
