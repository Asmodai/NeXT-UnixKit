This problem is directly related to the FOPEN_MAX/OPEN_MAX parameter used in
the stdio library by the BeOS. It seems that the BeOS strictly enforces this
number to the point that opening the 128th file causes all previously opened
files (except stdin/out/err) to be closed - hence the bad number.

I've tried this outside of gawk and the same thing happens, so it's not a
gawk problem.

I've spent the past few days trying to find a suitable workaround, but it's
obviously difficult trying to patch a kernel from the outside :))

I'll be reporting this as a bug to Be shortly.
