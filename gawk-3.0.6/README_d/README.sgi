GCC and gawk often don't mix on SGI systems.  Use the native C compiler to
compile gawk.  `make test' should work ok, although the `tweakfld' test
may fail.  That's ok; see README.ultrix for the details on that one.

Note that the SGI compiler will complain about some constructs in
regex.c and dfa.c.  It's ok to ignore those complaints.

If you ask me about this, I will fuss at you for not having done
your homework!
