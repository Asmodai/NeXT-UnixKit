This directory contains some examples/test-cases for different
features of gawk - mostly not present in an old awk.  Some are from
"The GAWK Manual", some are original, and some are mixture of the two.
Read header comments before attempting to use.  Have fun and remember
that program which consists only of BEGIN block does not need an input
file.
