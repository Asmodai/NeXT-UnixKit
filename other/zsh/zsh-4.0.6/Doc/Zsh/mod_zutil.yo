COMMENT(!MOD!zsh/zutil
Some utility builtins, e.g. the one for supporting configuration via 
styles.
!MOD!)
cindex(builtins, utility)
The tt(zsh/zutil) module only adds some builtins:

startitem()
findex(zstyle)
xitem(tt(zstyle) [ tt(-L) ])
xitem(tt(zstyle) [ tt(-e) | tt(-) | tt(-)tt(-) ] var(pattern) var(style) var(strings) ...)
xitem(tt(zstyle -d) [ var(pattern) [ var(styles) ... ] ])
xitem(tt(zstyle -g) var(name) [ var(pattern) [ var(style) ] ])
xitem(tt(zstyle -abs) var(context) var(style) var(name) [ var(sep) ])
xitem(tt(zstyle -Tt) var(context) var(style) [ var(strings) ...])
item(tt(zstyle -m) var(context) var(style) var(pattern))(
This builtin command is used to define and lookup styles.  Styles are
pairs of names and values, where the values consist of any number of
strings.  They are stored together with patterns and lookup is done by
giving a string, called the `context', which is compared to the
patterns.  The definition stored for the first matching pattern will be 
returned.

For ordering of comparisons, patterns are searched from most specific to
least specific, and patterns that are equally specific keep the order in 
which they were defined.  A pattern is considered to be more specific
than another if it contains more components (substrings separated by
colons) or if the patterns for the components are more specific, where 
simple strings are considered to be more specific than patterns and
complex patterns are considered to be more specific than the pattern
`tt(*)'.

The first form (without arguments) lists the definitions in the order
tt(zstyle) will test them. If the tt(-L) option is given, listing is
done in the form of calls to tt(zstyle).  Forms with arguments:

startitem()
item(tt(zstyle) [ tt(-) | tt(-)tt(-) | tt(-e) ] var(pattern) var(style) var(strings) ...)(
vindex(reply, use of)
Defines the given var(style) for the var(pattern) with the var(strings) as
the value.  If the tt(-e) option is given, the var(strings) will be
concatenated (separated by spaces) and the resulting string will be
evaluated (in the same way as it is done by the tt(eval) builtin
command) when the style is looked up.  In this case the parameter
`tt(reply)' must be assigned to set the strings returned after the
evaluation.  Before evaluating the value, tt(reply) is unset, and
if it is still unset after the evaluation, the style is treated as if
it were not set.
)
item(tt(zstyle -d) [ var(pattern) [ var(styles) ... ] ])(
Delete style definitions. Without arguments all definitions are deleted,
with a var(pattern) all definitions for that pattern are deleted and if
any var(styles) are given, then only those styles are deleted for the
var(pattern).
)
item(tt(zstyle -g) var(name) [ var(pattern) [ var(style) ] ])(
Retrieve a style definition. The var(name) is
used as the name of an array in which the results are stored. Without
any further arguments, all var(patterns) defined are returned. With a
var(pattern) the styles defined for that pattern are returned and with 
both a var(pattern) and a var(style), the value strings of that
combination is returned.
)
enditem()

The other forms can be used to look up or test patterns.

startitem()
item(tt(zstyle -s) var(context) var(style) var(name) [ var(sep) ])(
The parameter var(name) is set to the value of the style interpreted as a
string.  If the value contains several strings they are concatenated with
spaces (or with the var(sep) string if that is given) between them.
)
item(tt(zstyle -b) var(context) var(style) var(name))(
The value is stored in var(name) as a boolean, i.e. as the string
`tt(yes)' if the value has only one string and that string is equal to one
of `tt(yes)', `tt(true)', `tt(on)', or `tt(1)'. If the value is any other
string or has more than one string, the parameter is set to `tt(no)'.
)
item(tt(zstyle -a) var(context) var(style) var(name))(
The value is stored in var(name) as an array. If var(name) is declared 
as an associative array,  the first, third, etc. strings are used as the
keys and the other strings are used as the values.
)
xitem(tt(zstyle -t) var(context) var(style) [ var(strings) ...])
item(tt(zstyle -T) var(context) var(style) [ var(strings) ...])(
Test the value of a style, i.e. the tt(-t) option only returns a status
(sets tt($?)).  Without any var(strings) the return status is zero if the
style is defined for at least one matching pattern, has only one string in
its value, and that is equal to one of `tt(true)', `tt(yes)', `tt(on)' or
`tt(1)'. If any var(strings) are given the status is zero if and only if
at least one of the var(strings) is equal to at least one of the strings
in the value. If the style is not defined, the status is tt(2).

The tt(-T) option tests the values of the style like tt(-t), but it
returns zero (rather than tt(2)) if the style is not defined for any
matching pattern.
)
item(tt(zstyle -m) var(context) var(style) var(pattern))(
Match a value. Returns status zero if the 
var(pattern) matches at least one of the strings in the value.
)
enditem()
)
findex(zformat)
xitem(tt(zformat -f) var(param) var(format) var(specs) ...)
item(tt(zformat -a) var(array) var(sep) var(specs) ...)(
This builtin provides two different forms of formatting. The first form 
is selected with the tt(-f) option. In this case the var(format)
string will be modified by replacing sequences starting with a percent 
sign in it with strings from the var(specs).  Each var(spec) should be
of the form `var(char)tt(:)var(string)' which will cause every
appearance of the sequence `tt(%)var(char)' in var(format) to be replaced 
by the var(string).  The `tt(%)' sequence may also contain optional
minimum and maximum field width specifications between the `tt(%)' and 
the `var(char)' in the form `tt(%)var(min)tt(.)var(max)tt(c)',
i.e. the minimum field width is given first and if the maximum field
width is used, it has to be preceded by a dot.  Specifying a minimum field
width makes the result be padded with spaces to the right if the
var(string) is shorter than the requested width.  Padding to the left
can be achieved by giving a negative minimum field width.  If a maximum 
field width is specified, the var(string) will be truncated after that
many characters.  After all `tt(%)' sequences for the given var(specs)
have been processed, the resulting string is stored in the parameter
var(param).

The second form, using the tt(-a) option, can be used for aligning
strings.  Here, the var(specs) are of the form
`var(left)tt(:)var(right)' where `var(left)' and `var(right)' are
arbitrary strings.  These strings are modified by replacing the colons
by the var(sep) string and padding the var(left) strings with spaces 
to the right so that the var(sep) strings in the result (and hence the 
var(right) strings after them) are all aligned if the strings are
printed below each other.  All strings without a colon are left
unchanged and all strings with an empty var(right) string have the
trailing colon removed.  In both cases the lengths of the strings
are not used to determine how the other strings are to be aligned.
The resulting strings are stored in the var(array).
)
findex(zregexparse)
item(tt(zregexparse))(
This implements some internals of the tt(_regex_arguments) function.
)
findex(zparseopts)
item(tt(zparseopts) [ tt(-D) ] [ tt(-K) ] [ tt(-E) ] [ tt(-a) var(array) ] [ tt(-A) var(assoc) ] var(specs))(
This builtin simplifies the parsing of options in positional parameters,
i.e. the set of arguments given by tt($*).  Each var(spec) describes one
option and must be of the form `var(opt)[tt(=)var(array)]'.  If an option
described by var(opt) is found in the positional parameters it is copied
into the var(array) specified with the tt(-a) option; if the optional
`tt(=)var(array)' is given, it is instead copied into that array.

Note that it is an error to give any var(spec) without an
`tt(=)var(array)' unless one of the tt(-a) or tt(-A) options is used.

Unless the tt(-E) option is given, parsing stops at the first string
that isn't described by one of the var(specs).  Even with tt(-E),
parsing always stops at a positional parameter equal to `tt(-)' or
`tt(-)tt(-)'.

The var(opt) description must be one of the following.  Any of the special
characters can appear in the option name provided it is preceded by a
backslash.

startitem()
xitem(var(name))
item(var(name)tt(+))(
The var(name) is the name of the option without the leading `tt(-)'.  To
specify a GNU-style long option, one of the usual two leading `tt(-)' must
be included in var(name); for example, a `tt(--file)' option is
represented by a var(name) of `tt(-file)'.

If a `tt(+)' appears after var(name), the option is appended to var(array)
each time it is found in the positional parameters; without the `tt(+)'
only the em(last) occurrence of the option is preserved.

If one of these forms is used, the option takes no argument, so parsing
stops if the next positional parameter does not also begin with `tt(-)'
(unless the tt(-E) option is used).
)
xitem(var(name)tt(:))
xitem(var(name)tt(:-))
item(var(name)tt(::))(
If one or two colons are given, the option takes an argument; with one
colon, the argument is mandatory and with two colons it is optional.  The
argument is appended to the var(array) after the option itself.

An optional argument is put into the same array element as the option name
(note that this makes empty strings as arguments indistinguishable).  A
mandatory argument is added as a separate element unless the `tt(:-)' form
is used, in which case the argument is put into the same element.

A `tt(+)' as described above may appear between the var(name) and the
first colon.
)
enditem()

The options of tt(zparseopts) itself are:

startitem()
item(tt(-a) var(array))(
As described above, this names the default array in which to store the
recognised options.
)
item(tt(-A) var(assoc))(
If this is given, the options and their values are also put into an
associative array with the option names as keys and the arguments (if any)
as the values.
)
item(tt(-D))(
If this option is given, all options found are removed from the positional
parameters of the calling shell or shell function, up to but not including
any not described by the var(specs).  This is similar to using the tt(shift)
builtin.
)
item(tt(-K))(
With this option, the arrays specified with the tt(-a) and tt(-A)
options and with the `tt(=)var(array)' forms are kept unchanged when none
of the var(specs) for them is used.  This allows assignment of default
values to them before calling tt(zparseopts).
)
item(tt(-E))(
This changes the parsing rules to em(not) stop at the first string
that isn't described by one of the var(spec)s.  It can be used to test
for or (if used together with tt(-D)) extract options and their
arguments, ignoring all other options and arguments that may be in the
positional parameters.
)
enditem()

For example,

example(set -- -a -bx -c y -cz baz -cend
zparseopts a=foo b:=bar c+:=bar)

will have the effect of

example(foo=(-a)
bar=(-b x -c y -c z))

The arguments from `tt(baz)' on will not be used.

As an example for the tt(-E) option, consider:

example(set -- -a x -b y -c z arg1 arg2
zparseopts -E -D b:=bar)

will have the effect of

example(bar=(-b y)
set -- -a x -c z arg1 arg2)

I.e., the option tt(-b) and its arguments are taken from the
positional parameters and put into the array tt(bar).
