.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The Zsh source distribution includes a number of items contributed by the
user community\&.  These are not inherently a part of the shell, and some
may not be available in every zsh installation\&.  The most significant of
these are documented here\&.  For documentation on other contributed items
such as shell functions, look for comments in the function source files\&.

.SS "Accessing On\-Line Help"
.PP
The key sequence \fBESC h\fP is normally bound by ZLE to execute the
\fBrun\-help\fP widget (see
\fIzshzle\fP(1))\&.  This invokes the \fBrun\-help\fP command with the command word from the
current input line as its argument\&.  By default, \fBrun\-help\fP is an alias
for the \fBman\fP command, so this often fails when the command word is a
shell builtin or a user\-defined function\&.  By redefining the \fBrun\-help\fP
alias, one can improve the on\-line help provided by the shell\&.
.PP
The \fBhelpfiles\fP utility, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is a Perl program that can be used to process the zsh manual
to produce a separate help file for each shell builtin and for many other
shell features as well\&.  The autoloadable \fBrun\-help\fP function, found in
\fBFunctions/Misc\fP, searches for these helpfiles and performs several
other tests to produce the most complete help possible for the command\&.
.PP
There may already be a directory of help files on your system; look in
\fB/usr/share/zsh\fP or \fB/usr/local/share/zsh\fP and subdirectories below
those, or ask your system administrator\&.
.PP
To create your own help files with \fBhelpfiles\fP, choose or create a
directory where the individual command help files will reside\&.  For
example, you might choose \fB~/zsh_help\fP\&.  If you unpacked the zsh
distribution in your home directory, you would use the commands:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBmkdir ~/zsh_help
cd ~/zsh_help
man zshall | colcrt \- | \e 
perl ~/zsh\-4\&.0\&.6/Util/helpfiles\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Next, to use the \fBrun\-help\fP function, you need to add lines something
like the following to your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or equivalent startup file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBunalias run\-help
autoload run\-help
HELPDIR=~/zsh_help\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fBHELPDIR\fP parameter tells \fBrun\-help\fP where to look for the help
files\&.  If your system already has a help file directory installed, set
\fBHELPDIR\fP to the path of that directory instead\&.
.PP
Note that in order for `\fBautoload run\-help\fP' to work, the \fBrun\-help\fP
file must be in one of the directories named in your \fBfpath\fP array (see
\fIzshparam\fP(1))\&.  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy \fBFunctions/Misc/run\-help\fP to an
appropriate directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Recompiling Functions"
.PP
If you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your zsh
installation to track the latest developments, you may find that function
digests compiled with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin are frequently out of date
with respect to the function source files\&.  This is not usually a problem,
because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a function, but
it may cause slower shell startup and function loading\&.  Also, if a digest
file is explicitly used as an element of \fBfpath\fP, zsh won't check whether
any of its source files has changed\&.
.PP
The \fBzrecompile\fP autoloadable function, found in \fBFunctions/Misc\fP, can
be used to keep function digests up to date\&.

\fBzrecompile\fP [ \fB\-qt\fP ] \fB\-p\fP \fIargs\fP [ \fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP \fIargs\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
This tries to find \fB*\&.zwc\fP files and automatically re\-compile them if at
least one of the original files is newer than the compiled file\&.  This
works only if the names stored in the compiled files are full paths or are
relative to the directory that contains the \fB\&.zwc\fP file\&.
.RS
.PP
In the first form, each \fIname\fP is the name of a compiled file or a
directory containing \fB*\&.zwc\fP files that should be checked\&.  If no
arguments are given, the directories and \fB*\&.zwc\fP files in \fBfpath\fP are
used\&.
.PP
When \fB\-t\fP is given, no compilation is performed, but a return status of
zero (true) is set if there are files that need to be re\-compiled and
non\-zero (false) otherwise\&.  The \fB\-q\fP option quiets the chatty output
that describes what \fBzrecompile\fP is doing\&.
.PP
Without the \fB\-t\fP option, the return status is zero if all files that
needed re\-compilation could be compiled and non\-zero if compilation for at
least one of the files failed\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-p\fP option is given, the \fIargs\fP are interpreted as one
or more sets of arguments for \fBzcompile\fP, separated by `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP'\&.
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzrecompile \-p \e 
           \-R ~/\&.zshrc \-\- \e 
           \-M ~/\&.zcompdump \-\- \e 
           ~/zsh/comp\&.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This compiles \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP into \fB~/\&.zshrc\&.zwc\fP if that doesn't exist or
if it is older than \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP\&. The compiled file will be marked for
reading instead of mapping\&. The same is done for \fB~/\&.zcompdump\fP and
\fB~/\&.zcompdump\&.zwc\fP, but this compiled file is marked for mapping\&. The
last line re\-creates the file \fB~/zsh/comp\&.zwc\fP if any of the files
matching the given pattern is newer than it\&.
.PP
Without the \fB\-p\fP option, \fBzrecompile\fP does not create function digests
that do not already exist, nor does it add new functions to the digest\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
The following shell loop is an example of a method for creating function
digests for all functions in your \fBfpath\fP, assuming that you have write
permission to the directories:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfor ((i=1; i <= $#fpath; ++i)); do
  dir=$fpath[i]
  zwc=${dir:t}\&.zwc
  if [[ $dir == (\&.|\&.\&.) || $dir == (\&.|\&.\&.)/* ]]; then
    continue
  fi
  files=($dir/*(N\-\&.))
  if [[ \-w $dir:h && \-n $files ]]; then
    files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})
    if ( cd $dir:h &&
         zrecompile \-p \-U \-z $zwc $files ); then
      fpath[i]=$fpath[i]\&.zwc
    fi
  fi
done\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fB\-U\fP and \fB\-z\fP options are appropriate for functions in the default
zsh installation \fBfpath\fP; you may need to use different options for your
personal function directories\&.
.PP
Once the digests have been created and your \fBfpath\fP modified to refer to
them, you can keep them up to date by running \fBzrecompile\fP with no
arguments\&.
.PP
.SS "Keyboard Definition"
.PP
The large number of possible combinations of keyboards, workstations,
terminals, emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
have built\-in key bindings for every situation\&.  The \fBzkbd\fP utility,
found in Functions/Misc, can help you quickly create key bindings for your
configuration\&.
.PP
Run \fBzkbd\fP either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell script:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzsh \-f ~/zsh\-4\&.0\&.6/Functions/Misc/zkbd\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
When you run \fBzkbd\fP, it first asks you to enter your terminal type; if
the default it offers is correct, just press return\&.  It then asks you to
press a number of different keys to determine characteristics of your
keyboard and terminal; \fBzkbd\fP warns you if it finds anything out of the
ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither \fB^H\fP nor \fB^?\fP\&.
.PP
The keystrokes read by \fBzkbd\fP are recorded as a definition for an
associative array named \fBkey\fP, written to a file in the subdirectory
\fB\&.zkbd\fP within either your \fBHOME\fP or \fBZDOTDIR\fP directory\&.  The name
of the file is composed from the \fBTERM\fP, \fBVENDOR\fP and \fBOSTYPE\fP
parameters, joined by hyphens\&.
.PP
You may read this file into your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or another startup file with
the "source" or "\&." commands, then reference the \fBkey\fP parameter in
bindkey commands, like this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBsource ${ZDOTDIR:\-$HOME}/\&.zkbd/$TERM\-$VENDOR\-$OSTYPE
[[ \-n ${key[Left]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Left]}" backward\-char
[[ \-n ${key[Right]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Right]}" forward\-char
# etc\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that in order for `\fBautoload zkbd\fP' to work, the \fBzkdb\fP file must
be in one of the directories named in your \fBfpath\fP array (see
\fIzshparam\fP(1))\&.  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy \fBFunctions/Misc/zkbd\fP to an
appropriate directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Dumping Shell State"
.PP
Occasionally you may encounter what appears to be a bug in the shell,
particularly if you are using a beta version of zsh or a development
release\&.  Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the
problem to one of the zsh mailing lists (see
\fIzsh\fP(1)), but sometimes one of the zsh developers will need to recreate your
environment in order to track the problem down\&.
.PP
The script named \fBreporter\fP, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is provided for this purpose\&.  (It is also possible to
\fBautoload reporter\fP, but \fBreporter\fP is not installed in \fBfpath\fP
by default\&.)  This script outputs a detailed dump of the shell state,
in the form of another script that can be read with `\fBzsh \-f\fP' to
recreate that state\&.
.PP
To use \fBreporter\fP, read the script into your shell with the `\fB\&.\fP'
command and redirect the output into a file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\&. ~/zsh\-4\&.0\&.6/Util/reporter > zsh\&.report\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
You should check the \fBzsh\&.report\fP file for any sensitive information
such as passwords and delete them by hand before sending the script to the
developers\&.  Also, as the output can be voluminous, it's best to wait for
the developers to ask for this information before sending it\&.
.PP
You can also use \fBreporter\fP to dump only a subset of the shell state\&.
This is sometimes useful for creating startup files for the first time\&.
Most of the output from reporter is far more detailed than usually is
necessary for a startup file, but the \fBaliases\fP, \fBoptions\fP, and
\fBzstyles\fP states may be useful because they include only changes from
the defaults\&.  The \fBbindings\fP state may be useful if you have created
any of your own keymaps, because \fBreporter\fP arranges to dump the keymap
creation commands as well as the bindings for every keymap\&.
.PP
As is usual with automated tools, if you create a startup file with
\fBreporter\fP, you should edit the results to remove unnecessary commands\&.
Note that if you're using the new completion system, you should \fInot\fP
dump the \fBfunctions\fP state to your startup files with \fBreporter\fP; use
the \fBcompdump\fP function instead (see
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1))\&.

You should make sure all the functions from the \fBFunctions/Prompts\fP
directory of the source distribution are available; they all begin with
the string `\fBprompt_\fP' except for the special function`\fBpromptinit\fP'\&.
You also need the `\fBcolors\fP' function from \fBFunctions/Misc\fP\&.  All of
these functions may already have been installed on your system; if not,
you will need to find them and copy them\&.  The directory should appear as
one of the elements of the \fBfpath\fP array (this should already be the
case if they were installed), and at least the function \fBpromptinit\fP
should be autoloaded; it will autoload the rest\&.  Finally, to initialize
the use of the system you need to call the \fBpromptinit\fP function\&.  The
following code in your \fB\&.zshrc\fP will arrange for this; assume the
functions are stored in the directory \fB~/myfns\fP:

\fBpredict\-on\fP
This set of functions implements predictive typing using history search\&.
After \fBpredict\-on\fP, typing characters causes the editor to look backward
in the history for the first line beginning with what you have typed so
far\&.  After \fBpredict\-off\fP, editing returns to normal for the line found\&.
In fact, you often don't even need to use \fBpredict\-off\fP, because if the
line doesn't match something in the history, adding a key performs
standard completion, and then inserts itself if no completions were found\&.
However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to confuse prediction;
see the \fBtoggle\fP style below\&.
.RS
.PP
With the function based completion system (which is needed for this), you
should be able to type \fBTAB\fP at almost any point to advance the cursor
to the next ``interesting'' character position (usually the end of the
current word, but sometimes somewhere in the middle of the word)\&.  And of
course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you can accept with
return, without needing to move the cursor to the end first\&.

.RE

With a numeric prefix, it behaves like \fBinsert\-last\-word\fP, except that
words in comments are ignored when \fBINTERACTIVE_COMMENTS\fP is set\&.
.PP
Otherwise, the rightmost ``interesting'' word from the previous command is
found and inserted\&.  The default definition of ``interesting'' is that the
word contains at least one alphabetic character, slash, or backslash\&.
This definition may be overridden by use of the \fBmatch\fP style\&.  The
context used to look up the style is the widget name, so usually the
context is \fB:insert\-last\-word\fP\&.  However, you can bind this function to
different widgets to use different patterns:
.PP

they invoke\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBbreak\-keys\fP
This style is used by the \fBincremental\-complete\-word\fP widget\&. Its value
should be a pattern, and all keys matching this pattern will cause the
widget to stop incremental completion without the key having any further
effect\&. Like all styles used directly by
\fBincremental\-complete\-word\fP, this style is looked up using the
context `\fB:incremental\fP'\&.
.TP
\fBcompleter\fP
The \fBincremental\-complete\-word\fP and \fBinsert\-and\-predict\fP widgets set
up their top\-level context name before calling completion\&.  This allows
one to define different sets of completer functions for normal completion
and for these widgets\&.  For example, to use completion, approximation and
correction for normal completion, completion and correction for
incremental completion and only completion for prediction one could use:
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle ':completion:*' completer \e 
        _complete _correct _approximate
zstyle ':completion:incremental:*' completer \e

zstyle ':completion:predict:*' completer \e

.fi
.RE
.PP
It is a good idea to restrict the completers used in prediction, because
they may be automatically invoked as you type\&.  The \fB_list\fP and
\fB_menu\fP completers should never be used with prediction\&.  The
\fB_approximate\fP, \fB_correct\fP, \fB_expand\fP, and \fB_match\fP completers may
be used, but be aware that they may change characters anywhere in the word
behind the cursor, so you need to watch carefully that the result is what
you intended\&.

\fBkey\fP
The cursor is left
after the \fIn\fPth occurrence of the character just inserted, where
\fIn\fP is the number of times that character appeared in the word
before completion was attempted\&.  In short, this has the effect of
leaving the cursor after the character just typed even if the

\fBcolors\fP
This function initializes several associative arrays to map color names to

\fBcolors\fP more than once\&.
.RS

The eight base colors are: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan,
and white\&.  Each of these has codes for foreground and background\&.  In
addition there are eight intensity attributes: bold, faint, standout,
underline, blink, reverse, and conceal\&.  Finally, there are six codes used
to negate attributes: none (reset all attributes to the defaults), normal
(neither bold nor faint), no\-standout, no\-underline, no\-blink, and
no\-reverse\&.
