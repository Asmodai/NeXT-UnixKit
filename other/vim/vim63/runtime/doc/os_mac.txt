There was a Mac port for version 3.0 of Vim.  Here are the first few lines
from the old file:

VIM Release Notes
Initial Macintosh release, VIM version 3.0

==============================================================================
1. Filename Convention					*mac-filename*

You can use either the unix or mac path separator or a mix of both. In order
to determine if the specified filename is relative to the current folder or
absolute (i.e. relative to the "Desktop"), the following algorithm is used:

	If the path start by a "/", the path is absolute
	If the path start by a ":", the path is relative
	If the path doesn't start by neither a "/" nor ":",
	  and a ":" is found before a "/" then the path is absolute
>
		:e /HD/text
		:e HD:text
<	Edit the file "text" of the disk "HD" >
		:e :src:main.c
		:e src/main.c
<	Edit the file "main.c" in the folder "src" in the current folder >
		:e os_mac.c
<	Edit the file "os_mac.c" in the current folder.

You can use the |$VIM| and |$VIMRUNTIME|  variable. >

		:so $VIMRUNTIME:syntax:syntax.vim

==============================================================================
2. .vimrc and .vim files				*mac-vimfile*

On the Mac files starting with a dot "." are discouraged, thus the rc files
are named "vimrc" or "_vimrc" and "gvimrc" or "_gvimrc". These files can be in
any format (mac, dos or unix).  Vim can handle any file format when the
|'nocompatible'| option is set, otherwise it will only handle mac format
files.

==============================================================================
3. Mac FAQ						*mac-faq*

Q: I can't enter non-ASCII character in Apple Terminal.
A: Under Window Settings, Emulation, make sure that "Escape non-ASCII
   characters" is not checked.

==============================================================================
4. Mac Lack						*mac-lack*

-The filenames containing both ":" and "/" are sometimes misinterpreted.
  (just re-execute the command)
-Scrollbar are not scrolling live, and  when only the arrow or scroll area,
   a limit of 32 line or page is scrolled.
-Syntax highlighting works on 68k Macs but is _really_ slow.

==============================================================================
5. Mac Bug Report					*mac-bug*

When reporting any Mac specific bug or feature change, please use the vim-mac
maillist |vim-mac|.  However, you need to be subscribed.  An alternative is to
send a message to the current MacVim maintainers:

	mac@vim.org

==============================================================================
6. Compiling Vim					*mac-compile*

See the file "src/INSTALLmac.txt" that comes with the source files.
